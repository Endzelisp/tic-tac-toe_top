Tic Tac Toe game || JavaScript Course The Odin Project

The purpose of this project is to put into practice function factories and the module pattern

Update Feb 11 2023

Throughout this project, I have been learning about various design patterns and software architecture. I faced challenges communicating between different modules, so I decided to implement an event-driven architecture.

I challenged myself to decouple the user interface from the logic of the game, so I am using the Module Pattern to encapsulate all the different elements which will be used for the user interface.
